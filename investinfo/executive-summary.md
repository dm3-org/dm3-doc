  Solving Fragmentation and Privacy Challenges in Web3 Messaging: The dm3
  Protocol
---

# Executive Summary

## TL;DR

The DM3 protocol addresses critical challenges in Web3 messaging, such as fragmentation, lack of interoperability, spam, and privacy concerns. With over 40 Web3 messaging solutions in development, none offer seamless communication across platforms. DM3 introduces a scalable, decentralized messaging network that leverages ENS-based identities, economic incentives for spam protection, and interoperability between existing messaging protocols. The protocol also integrates AI for private messaging assistance and aims to become the core standard for secure, interoperable communication in both Web3 and traditional ecosystems.

## Problem/Motivation

Enhancing global communication has been one of the Internet's greatest successes, yet significant challenges remain. Modern messaging solutions are plagued by fragmentation, lack of universal standards, vendor lock-in, spam, impersonation, and inadequate privacy protection. These issues are becoming more apparent and pressing as digital communication evolves. We believe that by applying the core principles and decentralized architecture of Web3 to the messaging domain, we can address these challenges and unlock a new era of secure, seamless, and interoperable communications.

Attempts to build Web3 native messaging platforms/protocols have resolved some of these issues, e.g., immutable identities by wallets or privacy (Waku, XMTP, ...), albeit there are still fundamental challenges:

* **Fragmentation/Lack of interoperability**—\
  More> than 42 Web3 messaging solutions are being developed (Waku/Status, XMTP, Wallet Connect, MailChain, Ethermail, Blockscan Chat, WalletChat, …). Most solutions are still closed ecosystems without interoperability with other solutions.\
  Many of those have raised significant funds (status: $105M\*, xmtp: $25M, Ethermail: $7M, MailChain $4.6M,  WalletConnect $25M\*,..., \* messaging is only part of the business).
*   **Low start problem**—

    A small group of users, still no network effect, and no one has yet created enough new functionality to encourage users to migrate their communications to new channels).\
    Compared with well-known web2 messengers, user communities are tiny (currently <1%).
* **Low scalability**—\
  Web3-based messaging solutions often build on broadcast networks (whisper, waku, xmtp, ...); while fitting well to particular use cases, such solutions are not scalable by design but need notable innovation yet to be developed to become able to handle many messages.
* **Spam**— \
  There is still a problem (e.g., chat in Coinbase Wallet based on XMTP).
* **No universal use**—\
  Because of missing interoperability, having a direct, secure conversation with wallets is still impossible.&#x20;
* **Lack of decentralization**—\
  Many solutions are still operated centralized, with the risk of single points of failure and potential privacy lacks.

**DM3** attempts to solve all these problems by:

1. **Creating a public registry for communication profiles** based on ENS and integrating any L2, other L1s, and cloud-based solutions that enable secure and private communication.
2. **Building a decentralized network of Message relay nodes** that is scalable by design and enables self-sovereign communication.
3. **Introducing** a lean, open, and easy-to-integrate **interoperability solution** for Web1/2/3 messaging protocols and solutions, including a comprehensive SDK.
4. Leveraging economic incentives to introduce Web3 native **spam protection.**
5. Providing **AI-based** but privacy-preserving **messaging assistance**. &#x20;

We are not creating yet another messenger but rather a core protocol (think of the Internet's core protocol, TCP/IP) that allows existing messaging protocols to interoperate efficiently and new messaging solutions to be built directly on top of it. Also, dm3 enables solutions like wallets, Web3 games, marketplaces, etc., to easily integrate secure and interoperable messaging.

## But why now?

### Web2 momentum:

* Centralized messengers are increasingly the focus of regulation (e.g., Durov's (Telegram) arrest narrative, the "Digital Markets Act," and proposed chat control of the EU, etc.).
* Prominent messengers control the market and prevent new and innovative solutions.
* Closed and centralized systems often provide only limited privacy and security and avoid real interoperability. Impersonation, spam, and scam/phishing attacks are increasing.
* Chatbots play an increasingly important role in many systems, undermining trustworthy communication.

### Web 3 momentum:

* **Wallets as Identities**—\
  As wallets and user-friendly name representations (using name services like ENS) evolve into unique digital identities, the need to facilitate not only transactions but also direct communication with specific wallets becomes crucial. The shift towards wallets being more than just financial tools underscores the importance of integrated messaging capabilities.
* **Proliferation of Messaging Protocols**—\
  With over 42 messaging solutions in development, the Web3 ecosystem is facing a significant fragmentation challenge. While other layers of the Web3 stack (like blockchains, DeFi, NFTs, and social platforms) have started to adopt aggregation and interoperability solutions, messaging remains highly fragmented. Unlike DeFi, where fragmentation impacts liquidity and pricing, fragmentation in messaging creates a more severe issue—complete communication breakdowns across platforms.
* **The emergence of Web3 Social Platforms**—\
  Web3 social platforms like Farcaster are gaining traction, but interoperability challenges persist. For example, there’s currently no seamless way to send messages from Warpcast to Lens, highlighting the urgent need for interoperable messaging solutions.
* **Convergence of Wallets and Messengers**—\
  Integrating wallets with messaging apps (e.g., Telegram + TON Wallet, Coinbase Wallet + XMTP) is becoming more common. Technologies like Telegram Mini Apps and Farcaster Frames are turning the wallet-messenger combo into the primary gateway for new users entering the Web3 world. However, this trend also risks breaking the composability that is central to Web3, further emphasizing the need for a unified, interoperable messaging protocol.

## Solution

With DM3, we provide a lean messaging protocol to connect existing solutions, enable new solutions, and establish a connected messaging ecosystem while consistently implementing Web3 ideals like decentralization, secure encryption, censorship resistance, privacy, etc.\
For detailed information, see [here](./#unique-features).&#x20;

## How the future of messaging looks like:

* Directly reach a specific person by his/her ENS/wallet/social network handle/name. They will receive a message in the app that it is convenient for them. Attract their attention by staking tokens.
* Single inbox: Get all your emails/messages in a single application. Use the client you prefer, whether a simple mobile application or a complex CRM system. Connect any local messaging (like in-app messaging of a particular app) to your inbox and control all your relevant conversations in one place.
* You can use all the functionality of Web3 inside messages via frames: send money, place bets, vote, etc.
* Set the level of message encryption and privacy as you need.
* Be 100% sure who sent you the message. No impersonated senders can trick you into scams.
* Let spammers pay and lose money if they send spam to your inbox. Increasing the sender's anti-spam deposit requirement keeps your inbox free of spam.
* You can use AI assistance within your messenger without the risk of losing privacy or sharing confidential information outside your inbox.

## Use Cases

The use cases describe various possible applications of DM3 technology and the DM3 network. The listed examples are applications that have already been analyzed and discussed or are already in the planning or implementation stages.

* **Embedded Messaging use-case:**\
  By simply connecting your wallet, you can send a message to an organization on its website or from user to user in a dApp. You can get a response wherever it is convenient for you. You can also link this conversation to your inbox. These chats can be direct conversations with persons, support chats, or similar. This can be an embedded messaging component or a simple button opening a messenger popup.\
  _Examples:_&#x20;
  * _polymorphic.capital_ website with direct messages to partners
  * Embedded messenger in _rethinkable.xyz_ (social media app)
* **Core-Protocol use-case:**\
  An innovative new messenger solution uses the DM3 protocol as its core. Users of this messenger are connected with any other DM3-interoperable messenger and can send messages to users of other messengers while using a new messenger.\
  _Examples:_
  * The _Hicoiny_ messenger utilizes DM3 as the core protocol
* **Interoperability use-case**\
  An existing messenger adds DM3 interoperability to join the DM3 messaging network. Users of this messenger can send and receive messages to and from any other messenger. Messaging bridges enable message exchange for other messengers. \
  _Examples:_
  * _Wallet Connect_ web3 inbox can send and receive DM3 messages.
  * _XMTP_ inbox can send and receive DM3 messages.
  * Any DM3 interoperable messenger can send messages to any _Telegram_ user.

## Business/Operation Model

The organization dm3.org gGmbH is a German non-profit limited liability company (“gemeinnützige GmbH”) coordinating specifications, development, and external contributions. All software and specification documents are published as open-source and public goods.

The value is in the DM3 network (represented by the DM3 token).

The DM3 Token is the utility token of the DM3 network with the following functions:

* Network utilities (spam protection, network services like enhanced privacy)
* Governance
* Standardization incentive

### Token economics

The DM3 token economic model centers on using DM3 tokens for network utilities, governance, and incentives for standardization. For instance, to reduce spam, users must deposit DM3 tokens as a promise not to send spam. If spam is detected, these tokens are burned, effectively deterring malicious activity.

Additionally, DM3 tokens are utilized to purchase network services such as enhanced privacy and delivery options, further driving demand as the network expands.&#x20;

As users increase, so does the demand for anti-spam deposits and network services, ensuring the tokens' continued demand. Regarding governance, DM3 token holders or their delegates participate in protocol decisions, voting on upgrades, and resource allocation. This decentralized governance ensures that users influence the protocol's evolution.

Tokens are also distributed to the community and partners to incentivize and drive standardization.

## Traction

The DM3 core protocol and DM3 embedded components are specified and implemented, and a reference implementation and the first network infrastructure are published and operational.

In the specification process, we talked to and aligned with many existing Web3 messaging solutions to evaluate the requirements for a standard interoperability protocol. The results of these consultations have been incorporated into the protocol specification's architecture and modules.\
**The specification of the DM3 core protocol (Message Transport Protocol) and the DM3 core architecture align with the requirements needed to build the interoperability layer.**

In particular, it has also been realized that, besides the Ethereum ecosystem, any other L1s or L2s and cloud services can be connected to the standardized communication registry. This allows the DM3 protocol to be integrated as a native messaging protocol in different ecosystems. \
**To enable DM3 to support different ecosystems, we specified and developed the cross-chain communication registry with links to cloud services, L2s, and L1s.**

We also aligned requirements with many dApps (wallets, marketplaces, Web3 games, Web3 social media, etc.) for embedded messaging.\
DM3 embedded components were developed and added to the first applications as part of the SDK development. In addition to these embedded use cases, applications started to be built entirely on top of DM3.&#x20;

## Why DM3?

With the DM3 protocol, we have specified and built the first Web3 messaging protocol based on Web3 values while also enabling interoperability. The core protocol's extremely lean architecture and modularity allow new apps to build on it and existing solutions to become interoperable without compromising their security, privacy, or UX.&#x20;

Furthermore, because DM3 is scalable by design, it is the first available solution suitable for establishing and successfully expanding the connected messaging ecosystem, whereby existing solutions from the Web2 and Web3 worlds can be integrated.

The systematic and practical use of Web3 technology (e.g., for the communication profile registry, spam protection, ...) and AI (e.g., for private messaging assistants) solves the fundamental problems of existing systems.
