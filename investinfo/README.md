# Investment Information

## DM3 is the web3 messaging interoperability protocol.

## Unique Features

* Messaging interoperability
* Web3-based Spam-Protection
* Scalable decentralized message relay node network with ENS-based communication registry\


## Technical details

o   focused on

§  secure end-to-end encryption

§  decentralization\
(no single point of failure, censorship resistant)

§  privacy (multi-level privacy)

§  interoperability (to other networks, services, apps)

§  scalability (by design, network can be extended to handle billions of messages)

o   modular protocol

§  lean core protocol (message transport protocol)

§  many protocol extensions for various messaging application (group chat, public chat, extended privacy, linked profiles, spam protection, UI components, …)

o   decentralized network and interoperability

§  based on a decentralized message relay node network

§  network scalable by design

§  enables interoperability to other messaging networks and messaging services.

§  Integration of existing messaging solutions via non-custodial messaging gateways and semi-custodial messaging bridges

§  Cross-chain, L2, Cloud-service compatibility by ENS CCIP-resolvers

o   web3 spam protection

§  Key/account-based message transmission

§  Token-based spam slushing.

&#x20;

·      dm3 Token

o   Utility token of the dm3 network

§  Governance

§  Incentive for Standardization

§  Utility function (spam protection, privacy, …)

o   Launch (plan) in Q4/2024
