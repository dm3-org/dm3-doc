# Private Token Sale Information 09/2024

## TL;DR

* **DM3 Protocol:** A decentralized, open-source protocol for web3 messaging and interoperability.
* **Token Sale:** Private sale of DM3 ERC20 tokens, with an initial max cap of 100 million tokens. Launch set for Q1/2025.
* **Core Features:** End-to-end encryption, decentralization, multi-level privacy, interoperability, and scalability.
* **Partnerships:** Integrations with ENS, Optimism, Gnosis, Lukso, Arbitrum, etc.
* **Financials:** €4M funding target with tokens priced at €0.80 each. In the former fundraising round (pre-seed), €850k was raised through grants and pre-seed funding.
* **Organization:** Managed by dm3.org gGmbH, a non-profit with community-driven governance.

## DM3 is the web3 messaging interoperability protocol.

### Unique Features
