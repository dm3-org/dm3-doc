# Investment Information 06/2024

## DM3 is the web3 messaging interoperability protocol.

### Unique Features

* Messaging interoperability
* Web3-based Spam-Protection
* Scalable decentralized message relay node network with ENS-based communication registry

***

### Technical details

* focused on
  * secure end-to-end encryption
  * decentralization\
    (no single point of failure, censorship-resistant)
  * privacy (multi-level privacy)
  * interoperability (to other networks, services, apps)
  * scalability (by design, the network can be extended to handle billions of messages)
* modular protocol
  * lean core protocol (message transport protocol)
  * many protocol extensions for various messaging applications (group chat, public chat, extended privacy, linked profiles, spam protection, UI components, …)
* decentralized network and interoperability
  * based on a decentralized message relay node network
  * network scalable by design
  * enables interoperability with other messaging networks and messaging services.
  * Integration of existing messaging solutions via non-custodial messaging gateways and semi-custodial messaging bridges
  * Cross-chain, L2, Cloud-service compatibility by ENS CCIP-resolvers
* web3 spam protection
  * Key/account-based message transmission
  * Token-based spam slushing.

### DM3 Token

* Utility token of the dm3 network
  * Governance
  * Incentive for Standardization
  * Utility function (spam protection, privacy, …)
* Launch (plan) in Q4/2024

***

### Company/organization/network info

* dm3.org gGmbH – a non-profit company that maintains and coordinates the development of the DM3 protocol, community building, and the dm3 ecosystem.
* DM3 protocol – open-source and public good of the community.
* The value is in the network (in the future, represented by the token)
* The community will be involved in the development and future decisions through token-based governance.

* €500k pre-seed investment (Q3/2023) from Polymorphic.capital \
  (at €45M network valuation at fully distributed token cap of 100M tokens with options for tokens at 0.45€ per token)

### Funding targetQ3/2024

* **€3-5M** \
  (at €80M network valuation at the fully distributed token cap of 100M tokens with the option for tokens at 0.80€ per token)
