# Linked Profiles (DM3LPP)

## Overview

For certain use cases, standalone (or anonymous) profiles that can optionally be linked and synchronized with the main profile are required. For example, a dApp could provide integrated in-app messaging, a website could allow direct contact with designated persons, or a billboard chat allows anonymous users to post statements. These functions can, for instance, be realized using the embedded **dm3** components.

Eventually, it might be desirable for users to connect to a dApp without disclosing their identity to send messages anonymously. Users should also be able to write a message from the embedded messaging widget independently of their messenger app, which is then optionally synchronized with their inbox.

In addition, security considerations may require using limited-scope profiles with restricted rights derived from the user's wallet, which should be linked optionally to the user's inbox.
