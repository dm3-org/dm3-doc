# Message Transport Protocol (DM3MTP)

The **Message Transport Protocol (DM3MTP)** is the minimum basic protocol and the foundation for interoperability. For a protocol, service, or application to be dm3-interoperable, only the DM3MTP must be implemented. Further protocol extensions are additional functions that are not necessary for interoperability.

The **Message Transport Protocol** defines:

* **Registry** for communication profiles.
* The **transmission protocol,** based on a decentralized network of delivery service nodes.
* Relevant **APIs** for Delivery Services.
