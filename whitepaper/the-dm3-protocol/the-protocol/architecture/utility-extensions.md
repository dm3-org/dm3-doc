# Utility extensions

Additional utility modules provide functions that help build messaging applications but are not directly connected to the messaging core protocol.

## **Embedded Services**

A particular strength of Web3 is its ability to digitize not only information but also values and make them transferable. With the embedded services extension, additional applications can be integrated into conversations. This can be the direct transfer of tokens in a message or any interaction with other dApps.

## **Storage**

The dm3 storage extension provides an effective hierarchical storage scheme for fully encrypted conversations. The focus is on storing conversations and messages so they can be accessed quickly and efficiently, regardless of whether the data is stored locally, in a database, or in decentralized storage.

## **Notification**

Notifying that a message has been received and is waiting to be picked up is crucial to implementing a user-friendly messenger. The notification extension provides various options for such notifications. Particular attention is paid to ensuring that security and privacy are not unintentionally restricted.
