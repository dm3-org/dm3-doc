# Motivation

_The DM3 protocol is a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted messaging protocol. It aims to bridge cross-platform interoperability gaps without compromising security, privacy, or user experience, transforming the messaging ecosystem for a connected and self-sovereign communications future._

## The Mission

The mission is to set the stage for a new era of communication in Web3 by breaking down the barriers of centralized Web2 platforms and establishing new standards for user-centric, self-sovereign communication. The focus is not to replace or displace existing and established solutions but to connect them. At the same time, however, the DM3 protocol is intended to provide new solutions with a suitable basis for building modern communication so that security, privacy, interoperability, and user self-sovereignty are at the center of attention.

## The Vision

We envision a world where individuals communicate freely and securely, where privacy is upheld as a fundamental right, and where the power dynamics of centralized platforms are rebalanced in favor of users. Beginning with Web3 Messaging, the DM3 protocol will create a connected messaging ecosystem that enables users to self-sovereignly manage their communications and messaging solutions and interoperate with others without compromising their security, privacy, and UX.
