# Motivation

The dm3 protocol provides a decentralized, end-to-end encrypted messaging protocol. It aims to bridge interoperability gaps across platforms without compromising security, privacy, or user experience, thereby transforming the messaging ecosystem for a connected and self-sovereign communication future.

## The Mission

Our mission sets the stage for a new era of communication in Web3 by breaking down the barriers set by centralized Web2 platforms and establishing new standards for user-centric, self-sovereign communication. The focus is not on replacing existing and established solutions or driving them out of the market but on connecting them. At the same time, however, the DM3 protocol is intended to provide new solutions with a suitable basis for setting up modern communication so that security, privacy, interoperability, and the user's self-sovereignty are at the center of attention.

## The Vision

We see a world where individuals communicate freely and securely, where privacy is upheld as a fundamental right, and where the power dynamics of centralized platforms are rebalanced in favor of users. Beginning with Web3 Messaging, the DM3 protocol will establish a connected messaging ecosystem that enables users to self-sovereignly manage their communication and messaging solutions and interoperate with others without compromising their security, privacy, and UX.
