# The DM3 Messenger

DM3 focuses, in particular, on the protocol's specification, implementation, and maintenance. The development of the connected messaging ecosystem, the community, and the partners play a decisive role in this.

The implementation of its messenger is based on the DM3 core protocol, and it is important to integrate all DM3 protocol extensions to be available as a reference implementation. The DM3 messenger should also present new ergonomic concepts to bring Web3 messaging from the niche world of Web3 enthusiasts into the mainstream and explore and offer new usage concepts.

The DM3 messenger is intended to be lean, dispense with unnecessary bells and whistles, and promote self-determined communication. To realistically demonstrate the concepts of DM3 in all environments, the messenger should be available as a web application, smartphone application, and desktop application.

A future governance decision by the community may support the extent to which Messenger will be expanded as a product with a stronger end-user focus.
