# Embedded Widgets

An important part of the Application Layer of DM3 is the embedded widgets. These UI components can be integrated into applications to make messaging functionality available. Many dApps, including wallets, trading platforms, games, social media applications, etc., require messaging functionality. This can be in-app messaging, support, contact platforms, etc.

With the DM3 embedded widgets, integration of a fully-fledged messaging solution based on DM3 and the associated interoperability with other solutions, linkable profiles, etc., is possible. These components can be integrated with just a few lines of code. Encryption, privacy, etc., are integral parts of the components. These integrations and the associated extensions to the infrastructure (including new message relay nodes) are also important building blocks in expanding the DM3 messaging ecosystem.

The components can be flexibly customized so that they can be seamlessly integrated into applications.
