# Token Distribution

The DM3 token is the utility and governance token of the DM3 network and is designed as a community token. This means that a large proportion of the tokens are issued to the community in several ways. The initial number of possible tokens is 100M. Several token pools are set up, although their size only represents the upper limits. Only the tokens that are actually issued are generated. The distribution takes place in 4 pools:

#### IP and development

Corpus.io, a venture/product studio for Web3 applications, realized the initial specification and development of DM3 from the idea to the MVP. With the spin-off of dm3.org, all IP, resources, and rights were transferred. This early support was compensated with options on future DM3 tokens. 20M tokens were reserved for this purpose.

As an incentive for the development team, this team will receive DM3 tokens if conditions are met that the first stage of standardization will be achieved by several protocols, services, or applications using the DM3 protocol and apps using the DM3 embedded components. For this purpose, 5M DM3 tokens are reserved.

#### Investors

A maximum of 15M DM3 tokens from the initial distribution are earmarked for external investors. These will be sold to institutional investors, Angle investors, etc., who are particularly active in the field of web3 messaging (including contributing to the dissemination of the standard through their network) and thus support the objectives of DM3.

#### Operation

10M of the tokens from the initial distribution are reserved for the operation of DM3. These tokens can be used or sold by dm3.org for important tasks. In addition, these tokens will also be used to provide liquidity.&#x20;

These tokens are intended for the first four years after publication of the token. In the following years, further tokens can be minted by dm3.org if there is a corresponding governance decision.
