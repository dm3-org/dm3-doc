# The DM3 Token and Tokenomics

The DM3 token is the utility token of the DM3 network. It is used to implement 3 main applications:

1. **Utility** applications in the DM3 network
2. **Governance** for the DM3 protocol
3. **Incentive** for standardization

## Token Standard

The DM3 token is designed as an ERC20 token and is deployed on Ethereum or a suitable layer 2. Depending on the required use cases, it is bridged to other chains. As a utility token following the provisions of MiCAR regulation, the token can be traded on centralized and decentralized exchanges. This is necessary, among other things, because users must be able to obtain tokens to perform certain network functions or participate in governance processes.
