# Abstract

_The DM3 (Decentralized Messaging for web3 or Direct Message 3) protocol is an end-to-end encrypted peer-to-peer messaging protocol rooted in ENS (Ethereum Name Service). It is **decentralized**, has no single points of failure, has a **lean architecture** with minimum resource requirements, and enables **interoperability** with other messaging solutions while preserving the **self-sovereignty** of its users._&#x20;

_The DM3 protocol uses ENS as a central registry for necessary contact information (like public keys, addresses of delivery services, ...), stored in ENS text records, in combination with a standardized API to build an open ecosystem of message delivery services allowing the send messages from ENS name to ENS name._
