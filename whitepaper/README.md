description: DM3 - the web3 messaging interoperability protocol
---

# Abstract

_DM3 is a web3 messaging protocol focused on security, decentralization, privacy, scalability, and interoperability. It is based on a decentralized network of message relay nodes and a standardized registry for communication profiles rooted in ENS (Ethereum Name Service). DM3's interoperability approach enables the connection and integration of different systems and the establishment of an interoperable, connected messaging ecosystem without compromising existing solutions' security, privacy, and UX._&#x20;

_Building on the lean core protocol, modular extensions provide solutions for many messaging applications, including outstanding spam protection, integrable components to easily integrate messaging functionality into apps, enhanced privacy, and much more._&#x20;

_The DM3 utility token powers token-based functions (such as spam protection, incentivization for privacy functions, etc.) but also serves as a governance token and incentive for standardization._
