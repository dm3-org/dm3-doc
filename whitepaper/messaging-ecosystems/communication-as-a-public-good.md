# Communication as a Public Good

Many current messaging solutions are developed by well-known large companies or organizations, and the software is often treated as a corporate secret. Closed-source software poses a particular risk, especially regarding security-relevant programs (including encryption, key management, privacy-relevant functions, etc.).&#x20;

The user must trust the provider that they have implemented everything correctly in their software and have not built in any backdoors for themselves or others. They must trust, too, that no unauthorized information is being captured.&#x20;

## Open Source - Open Standards

Trustless software is only possible if the source codes from which the software is built or which form the core of the used libraries are fully and openly accessible. Otherwise, censorship, privacy violations, and even insecure encryption cannot be ruled out without trusting the provider. Offering a secure messenger is not enough to promise secure software standards and, in the best case, even use them. The software must be verifiable and, above all, independent of a trusted provider.

The situation is very similar to the standards. Standards should not be defined by a powerful party that then enforces the quasi-standard with its market power (as has unfortunately very often been the case in the past). Nor should a standard be misused to allow a powerful party to consolidate its supremacy by imposing its interests by controlling the definition of the quasi-standard and dominating or even bullying smaller market participants. Open standards are most available to a community when they are available as a public good and open source. Then, everyone is free to contribute, the community can actively participate in the review and further development, and no party controls the code to the detriment of other market participants.

## Inclusivity and Accessibility

DM3 is designed as a public good based on open-source software. It is a community-driven protocol and application. The public good approach is essential to enable the protocol to be used in both large and small applications. All participants have the same rights, so neither large nor small solutions are disadvantaged or have to fear that they will suffer a disadvantage when using DM3.

Through the community's collective efforts, the protocol can evolve to achieve the goal of a connected messaging ecosystem. The specification and code are freely available, and the community can contribute important parts. The free availability as open source also enables companies and organizations behind established solutions to participate.
