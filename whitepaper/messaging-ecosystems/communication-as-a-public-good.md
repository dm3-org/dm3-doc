# Communication as a Public Good

Many current messaging solutions are developed by well-known large companies or organizations, and the software is often treated as a corporate secret. Closed-source software poses a particular risk, especially regarding security-relevant programs (including encryption, key management, privacy-relevant functions, etc.).&#x20;

The user must trust the provider that they have implemented everything correctly in their software and have not built in any backdoors for themselves or others. They must trust, too, that no unauthorized information is being captured.&#x20;

## Open Source - Open Standards

Trustless software is only possible if the source codes from which the software is built or which form the core of the used libraries are fully and openly accessible.
