#### **Transitioning to Protected and Confidential Communication**&#x20;

In a world where the metaverse increasingly hosts our interactions, this user base is poised to grow even further. This shift isn't just about expanding numbers; it's about users seeking alternatives that promise genuine privacy and security. They yearn for communication where they retain true ownership of their conversations, away from the prying eyes of centralized entities.

While the messaging landscape is currently dominated by centralized giants, the emergence of web3 players signals a new wave of possibilities. These players, rooted in blockchain technology, are pioneering the path to decentralized, secure, and private communication.

#### **The Potential of Blockchain**&#x20;

When delving into potential users who are already adopting chat and email services built upon blockchain technology, we uncover intriguing insights. More than 80 million crypto wallet users had been created by 2022 ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/647374/worldwide-blockchain-wallet-users/)), underscoring the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions. Within this cohort, a noteworthy 449,918 wallets were actively engaged on the Ethereum blockchain as of June 2023 ([source](https://www.demandsage.com/blockchain-statistics/)), highlighting the Ethereum network's prominence.

As a protocol deeply integrated with the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), the dm3 protocol's reach aligns with the Ethereum ecosystem. ENS, reporting over 50,000 monthly active users in September 2022 ([source](https://messari.io/report/state-of-ens-q3-2022)), solidifies the Ethereum blockchain as a stronghold for potential dm3 users.
