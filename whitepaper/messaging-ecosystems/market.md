### Market size (potential users)

In the ever-evolving world of communications, messaging has become a cornerstone of digital interaction. With the proliferation of modern messaging platforms, active users have risen sharply, demonstrating these tools' integral role in our connected world.

#### **The Current Landscape**&#x20;

Looking to the present, it's clear that messaging platforms have become a part of the lives of more than a quarter of the world's population. Around 26% of people [\[1\]](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/research/market-research/worldwide-messaging-apps/) use one or more messaging platforms, including well-known names such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Viber, Line, Snapchat, and more. WhatsApp leads with 3.03 billion monthly active users [\[2\]](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-whatsapp-users/),  followed by Telegram with 1.56 billion [\[3\]](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-telegram-users/), WeChat with 1.4 billion [\[4\]](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-wechat-users/), and Facebook Messenger with 1.04 billion [\[5\]](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-telegram-users/) monthly active users.

#### **Transitioning to Protected and Confidential Communication**&#x20;

In a world where the metaverse increasingly hosts our interactions, this user base is poised to grow even further. This shift isn't just about expanding numbers; it's about users seeking alternatives that promise genuine privacy and security. They yearn for communication where they retain true ownership of their conversations, away from the prying eyes of centralized entities.

While the messaging landscape is currently dominated by centralized giants, the emergence of Web3 players signals a new wave of opportunity. Rooted in blockchain technology, these players are paving the way for decentralized, secure, and private communications.

#### **The Potential of Blockchain**&#x20;

Interesting insights emerge when delving into potential users already using chat and email services based on blockchain technology. By 2022, more than 80 million people use crypto wallets, highlighting the growing interest in blockchain-based solutions [\[6\]](https://www.demandsage.com/blockchain-statistics/).

Blockchain technology has significant potential due to its decentralized, transparent, and secure nature.

Technology:

1. **Decentralization**—Eliminates the need for a central authority, reducing sources of error and manipulation.&#x20;
2. **Transparency**—Provides an immutable ledger where all transactions are recorded and visible to all participants.&#x20;
3. **Security**—Using cryptographic algorithms to secure transactions makes manipulation and fraud more difficult.&#x20;
4. **Smart Contracts**—Enables automated, self-executing contracts with pre-defined rules, eliminating middlemen.&#x20;
5. **Interoperability**—Facilitates seamless interaction between blockchain networks, improving data sharing and integration.

Based on these technologies, Web3-based systems are intended to build systems focused on

1. **Trustless environments**—Eliminates the need to trust third parties, relying on code and consensus mechanisms.&#x20;
2. **Decentralized Control**—Promotes user empowerment and control over personal data and assets.&#x20;
3. **Transparency and accountability**—Increases accountability through transparent and immutable records.&#x20;
4. **Censorship Resilience**—Prevents undue censorship and control by centralized entities.

#### Advantages of the DM3 Protocol in the Web3 Messaging Landscape

In the rapidly evolving messaging landscape, the DM3 protocol distinguishes itself by introducing several key advantages that change how we communicate in the Web3 era. These advantages usher in a new era of privacy, security, and interoperability:

* **Interoperable Standard with Privacy Focus**—The mission of the DM3 protocol is to connect disparate messaging systems through a standardized, interoperable protocol. It emphasizes self-sovereign communication while maintaining privacy and security. This focus on interoperability ensures that DM3 can be seamlessly integrated with different messaging platforms, creating a unified messaging experience across services.
* **Chain-Agnostic Approach**—DM3 follows a chain-agnostic approach. This flexibility allows the protocol to adapt and function across different blockchain networks and cloud-based solutions, ensuring widespread adoption without restrictions.
* **Comprehensive Scalability and Performance**—DM3 can handle many users and messages without compromising responsiveness. This scalability is vital as it accommodates the rapid growth of the Web3 community while maintaining a seamless user experience.
* **Modular Design and Extensions**—The DM3 protocol embraces a modular design, incorporating various extensions and optional features. This adaptability tailors its functionalities to diverse messaging needs, from private peer-to-peer conversations to group communication.
